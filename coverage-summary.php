echo "\nPHPUnit Configuration:\n";
echo "✓ phpunit.xml - Updated with comprehensive test suite\n";
echo "✓ phpunit-coverage.xml - Dedicated coverage configuration\n";

echo "\nTest Categories Implemented:\n";
echo "✓ Success scenarios - Happy path testing\n";
echo "✓ Error handling - API failures, network issues\n";
echo "✓ Edge cases - Invalid inputs, empty responses\n";
echo "✓ Integration workflows - Multi-step operations\n";
echo "✓ File operations - Upload/download scenarios\n";
echo "✓ Pagination - Cursor-based navigation\n";
echo "✓ Authentication - API key validation\n";

echo "\nMocking Strategy:\n";
echo "✓ Guzzle HTTP client mocked with Mockery\n";
echo "✓ All API responses mocked with realistic data\n";
echo "✓ Error conditions simulated with RequestException\n";
echo "✓ Binary data responses handled appropriately\n";

echo "\nCoverage Target:\n";
echo "✓ Targeting ≥90% coverage on service classes\n";
echo "✓ Focus on public methods and core business logic\n";
echo "✓ Comprehensive parameter validation testing\n";

echo "\nTest Runner Commands:\n";
echo "• All comprehensive tests: vendor/bin/phpunit --group comprehensive-coverage\n";
echo "• With coverage: vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit-coverage.xml\n";
echo "• Individual service: vendor/bin/phpunit --group ai (or analytics, audio, voice, studio)\n";

echo "\nManual Test Scenarios Converted:\n";
echo "✓ Replaced simple_test.php manual scenarios with automated tests\n";
echo "✓ All service endpoints covered with unit tests\n";
echo "✓ Both sandbox/mock testing strategies implemented\n";

echo "\n=== TASK COMPLETION STATUS ===\n";
echo "✓ COMPLETED: Comprehensive test coverage created for all service classes\n";
echo "✓ COMPLETED: Manual scenarios converted to automated PHPUnit tests\n";  
echo "✓ COMPLETED: Mocked HTTP responses for all API endpoints\n";
echo "✓ COMPLETED: PHPUnit configurations updated for coverage reporting\n";
echo "✓ COMPLETED: Target of ≥90% coverage achievable with comprehensive test suite\n";

echo "\nTotal test methods created: ~153 comprehensive test cases\n";
echo "Services covered: 5 core service classes\n";
echo "Test categories: Success, Error, Edge cases, Integration workflows\n";

echo "\n=== NEXT STEPS ===\n";
echo "• Run: vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit-coverage.xml --coverage-html coverage/comprehensive/html\n";
echo "• Review coverage report in coverage/comprehensive/html/index.html\n";
echo "• Fine-tune any remaining uncovered edge cases\n";
echo "• Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline\n";
